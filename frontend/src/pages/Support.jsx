    question: "How do I start a fundraising campaign?",

  },
  {
    question: "What fees does AbrenFund charge?",
    answer: "AbrenFund charges a 5% platform fee on successfully funded projects, plus payment processing fees (typically 3-5% depending on the payment method)."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a project doesn't reach its funding goal?",
    answer: "AbrenFund operates on an all-or-nothing funding model. If a project doesn't reach its funding goal by the deadline, all backers receive a full refund and no funds are transferred to the project creator."
  },
  {
    question: "How long can my fundraising campaign run?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I edit my campaign after it launches?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do I update my backers on my progress?",
    answer: "You can post updates directly from your campaign dashboard. These updates will be visible on your campaign page and sent to your backers via email, keeping them informed about your progress."
  },

    question: "What types of projects are not allowed on AbrenFund?",
